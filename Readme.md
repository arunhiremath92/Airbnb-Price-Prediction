The key stakeholders of AirBnb are guests and hosts. The host is the one who decides the
price of the listing. Generally, it is decided by just looking at the prices of similar listings
which may not be accurate since the price of the listing depends on many factors. The price
predicted by the system considering all factors like location, neighborhood score and
service charges etc will definitely reduce the possibility of the host putting low or high price.
Thus, hosts can put a more accurate price to their listings.

We will use an existing airbnb dataset which is available on Kaggle. For this project, we are
only considering one city.Dataset is distributed in three files listed below:

-Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
-Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
-Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day


File Details:

Coding Guidelines
-Just one, implement everything as modules.
-Add as many comments as possible
-Use the Jupyter's Markdown feature to write details about a module,
 this would help us in the end to quickly generate the documentation
 for project in one single click.
